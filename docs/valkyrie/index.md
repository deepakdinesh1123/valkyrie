# Valkyrie

Welcome to Valkyrie - your solution for seamless development environments powered by Nix. Valkyrie aims to eliminate the "it works on my machine" problem by providing reproducible environments across development, testing, and production stages.

## What is Valkyrie?

Valkyrie is a collection of projects designed to free developers from environment management concerns. By leveraging Nix, it ensures consistent and reproducible environments across all stages of development. Whether you're developing locally, running tests, or deploying to production, Valkyrie guarantees that your code runs in identical environments.

    Odin is our first project, focused on code execution. It allows developers to run code in reproducible environments without any local setup. Simply specify your language and dependencies, and Odin handles the rest - providing both code execution capabilities and local development environments through Nix.
