# Valkyrie MCP Server

Valkyrie MCP Server enables executing code in secure containers for tools such as Cursor, VSCode, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and more.

## Use Cases

- **Execute Code Generated by LLMs**: Seamlessly run code generated by language models in tools like Claude Desktop.
- **Test Code with Sample Inputs**: Safely test code snippets with sample inputs before integrating them into your projects.
- **Cross-Version Code Execution**: Run the same code across different versions to observe and compare its behavior.
- **Library Testing**: Experiment with different libraries without the need to install them on your local machine.

## Setup

To set up the Valkyrie MCP Server, add the following configuration to the tool of your choice:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "Valkyrie": {
            "command": "<path_to_uv>",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "<path_to_repo>/valkyrie/mcp/src/valkyrie-mcp",
                "run",
                "server.py"
            ]
        }
    }
